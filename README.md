comprehensive understanding of Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP) and its application in shared-memory multiprocessor systems.
Students will use the gem5 simulator to explore various architectures and techniques for
implementing TLP, analyze the challenges and trade-offs, and examine synchronization
mechanisms and memory consistency models
